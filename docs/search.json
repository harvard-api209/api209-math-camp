For instance, GSU has a special “Georgia State Blue” (■#0039A6) and a red accent (■#CC0000). The Urban Institute has a specific organizational color palette with all sorts of guidelines for comparing two groups, three groups, sequential data, diverging data, and other special situations. They have specific red and blue colors to use for political parties too, like ■#1696d2 for Democrats and ■#db2b27 for Republicans.\nI often find it helpful to make a little object that contains all the custom colors I want to use so I don’t have to remember what the cryptic hex codes mean. Here’s GSU’s full palette:\n\ngsu_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"#0039A6\", \"#CC0000\", \"#374057\", \"#0071CE\",\n  \"#00AEEF\", \"#97CAEB\", \"#EEEEEE\", \"#CCCCCC\", \"#767679\"\n)\n\nYou can access these colors by number:\n\ngsu_colors[1:2]\n## [1] \"#0039A6\" \"#CC0000\"\ngsu_colors[5]\n## [1] \"#00AEEF\"\ngsu_colors[c(3, 5, 9)]\n## [1] \"#374057\" \"#00AEEF\" \"#767679\"\n\nAnd you can use the show_col() function from the {scales} library to show them all:\n\nscales::show_col(gsu_colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use them in scale_fill_manual()/scale_color_manual() too:\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = gsu_colors[1:5]\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to be extra fancy, you can create more official custom color palettes like scale_fill_gsu().",

    "text": "Perceptually uniform and scientifically calibrated palettes\nYou aren’t limited to just the default ggplot color palettes, or even the default viridis palettes. There are lots of other perceptually uniform palettes that use special ranges of color that can either (1) be used as a sequential gradient or (2) be chopped up into equal distances to create recognizable distinct colors.\n\nThe Okabe-Ito palette\nMasataka Okabe and Kei Ito developed a qualitative color palette for all types of color-vision deficiencies in 2008, and Claus Wilke uses it throughout his Fundamentals of Data Visualization book that we use in this class (he explains why here).\n\nYou can use it with the {ggokabeito} package and scale_fill_okabe_ito()/scale_color_okabe_ito():\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviridis\nYou’ve seen the regular green/blue/yellow viridis palette throughout the class, but there are are a bunch of other palettes within viridis like magma, plasma, inferno, mako, rocket, and turbo.\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the viridis palettes are diverging, but they work great for both sequential and qualitative data.\nThe viridis palettes come with {ggplot2} and you can use them with scale_fill_viridis_d()/scale_color_viridis_d() for discrete data and scale_fill_viridis_c()/scale_color_viridis_c() for continuous data.\n\nplasmainfernomakoturbo\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"inferno\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"mako\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific colour maps\nThe {scico} package provides a ton of other similar well-designed palettes from the Scientific Colour Maps project. The project includes sequential, diverging, and qualitative palettes and even has multi-sequential and cyclic palettes.\n\nAfter loading the {scico} package, you can use these palettes with scale_fill_scico_d()/scale_color_scico_d() for discrete data and scale_fill_scico_c()/scale_color_scico_c() for continuous data.\n\nbatlowbamakohawaiiroma (diverging)broc (diverging)\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"batlow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"bamako\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"hawaii\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_diverging +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"roma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_diverging +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"broc\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorBrewer\nGeographer Cynthia Brewer developed a set of color palettes designed specifically for improving the readability of maps, but her palettes work incredibly well for regular plots too. There’s also a fantastic companion website for exploring all the different palettes, categories by sequential/diverging/qualitatitve, with options to filter by colorblind friendliness and print friendliness.\n\nTo use one of the palettes, note what it’s called at the website and use that name as the palette argument. The ColorBrewer palettes come with {ggplot2} and you can use them with scale_fill_brewer()/scale_color_brewer() for discrete data and scale_fill_distiller()/scale_color_distiller() for continuous data.\n\nYlOrRd (sequential)PuOr (diverging)Set1 (qualitative)\n\n\n\nplot_sequential +\n  scale_color_distiller(palette = \"YlOrRd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_diverging +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"PuOr\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARTOColors\nThe commerical GIS service CARTO created CARTOColors: a set of open source geographic-like colors just like ColorBrewer. Again, these were originally designed for maps, but they work great for regular data visualization too.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to install the {rcartocolor} package to use them. After loading {rcartocolor}, you can use any of the palettes with scale_fill_carto_d()/scale_color_carto_d() for discrete data and scale_fill_carto_c()/scale_color_carto_c() for continuous data.

    "text": "RStudio on your computer\nPosit.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of Posit.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since Posit.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.4.0) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including {ggplot2}) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall TinyTeX\nWhen you render to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s a smaller version named TinyTeX that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows and automatically installs any missing LaTeX packages as needed.\nHere’s how to install TinyTeX so you can create pretty PDFs:\n\nOpen the Terminal panel in RStudio (down in the bottom left corner where the Console panel is; there’s a tab named “Terminal” there)\nType this:\nquarto install tinytex",

On their own, the facts contained in raw data are difficult to understand, and in the absence of beauty and order, it is impossible to understand the truth that the data shows.\nIn this class, you’ll learn how to use industry-standard graphic and data design techniques to create beautiful, understandable visualizations and uncover truth in data.\nBy the end of this course, you will become (1) literate in data and graphic design principles, and (2) an ethical data communicator, by producing beautiful, powerful, and clear visualizations of your own data. Specifically, you should:\n\nUnderstand the principles of data and graphic design\nEvaluate the credibility, ethics, and aesthetics of data visualizations\nCreate well-designed data visualizations with appropriate tools\nShare data and graphics in open forums\nBe curious and confident in consuming and producing data visualizations\n\nThis class will expose you to R—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to visualize and analyze any sort of data-based question in the future."

Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.

There are free online version of all the textbooks, R and RStudio are inherently free, and GSU provides free access to Adobe Illustrator.\n\nBooks, articles, and other materials\nWe’ll rely heavily on these books, which are all available online (for free!). I recommend getting the printed versions of these books if you are interested, but it is not required.\n\nAlberto Cairo, The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication (Berkeley, California: New Riders, 2016). $20 used, $50 new at Amazon.\nA free eBook version is available through GSU’s library through O’Reilly’s Higher Education database. The easiest way to access it is to visit a special URL (http://go.oreilly.com/georgia-state-university), log in with your GSU account, and then search for “The Truthful Art”.\nKieran Healy, Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2018), http://socviz.co/. FREE online; $20 used, $40 new at Amazon.\nClaus E. Wilke, Fundamentals of Data Visualization (Sebastopol, California: O’Reilly Media, 2018), https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/. FREE online; $36 used, $50 new at Amazon. An eBook version is also available through the O’Reilly database, but you can just use the online version.\n\nThere will occasionally be additional articles and videos to read and watch. When this happens, links to these other resources will be included on the content page for that session.\nI also highly recommend subscribing to the R Weekly newsletter. This e-mail is sent every Monday and is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.\n\n\nR and RStudio\nYou will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations produces the actual statistics and graphical output, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free Posit.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in Posit.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for examples, exercises, and mini projects.\nPosit.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis and graphics. You also can’t use your own custom fonts with Posit.cloud. Over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of Posit.cloud. This isn’t 100% necessary, but it’s helpful.\nYou can find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n\n\nOnline help\nData science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and Posit Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)).\nIf you use Mastodon or Twitter, post R-related questions and content with #rstats. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.\nChatGPT is generally relatively okay with R questions, but it will often hallucinate responses—it really likes to imagine packages that don’t exist and then give you answers with them. Think of it as glorified autocomplete. I’d encourage you to read the first few paragraphs here about a few important things to keep in mind when using ChatGPT, though.\nSearching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”). Also, since most of your R work will deal with {ggplot2}, it’s often easier to just search for that instead of the letter “r” (e.g. “ggplot scatterplot”).\nAdditionally, we have a class chatroom at Slack where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly. (It’s one of the rare Slack workspaces where I actually have notifications enabled!) Ask questions about the readings, exercises, and mini projects. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too."

I’ve designed this asynchronous system with you specifically in mind. I also can only really do teaching work at night when my kids are in bed—I recorded all these videos between like 10 PM and 2 AM.

This means that I will be in my office at home (wistfully) waiting for you to come by talk to me remotely with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns.\nBecause of the pandemic, I am not on campus often and generally cannot meet in person. I will generally try to be on campus at least once a week though (typically on Mondays), and I can always meet you online via Webex. Make an appointment with me here. You can choose an online or in-person slot—if you choose an online slot, the confirmation e-mail will contain a link for a Webex meeting. You can also find me through e-mail and Slack.\n\n\nLearning during a pandemic\nLife absolutely sucks right now. None of us is really okay. We’re all just pretending.\nYou most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have gotten COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities—you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).\nI’m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges. Under pandemic conditions, that flexibility and leniency is intensified.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. I hope you’ll extend me the same grace.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through, though. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nIf you need extra help, or if you need more time with something, or if you feel like you’re behind or not understanding everything, do not suffer in silence! Talk to me! I will work with you. I promise.\nPlease sign up for a time to meet with me during student hours at https://calendly.com/andrewheiss/. I’m also available through e-mail and Slack. I’ve enabled notifications on my Slack account, so I’ll see your messages quickly!\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class (Graphic design! Fancy charts! R! ggplot!), but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\n\n\nLate work\nWith the exception of the mini projects and the final project, there’s no penalty for late work. I would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, that’s fine. I might not be able to give you good feedback if you turn something in late, but that’s really the only practical penalty—there’s no harm to your grade.\n\n\nCounseling and Psychological Services (CPS)\nLife at GSU can be complicated and challenging (especially during a pandemic!). You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) provides free, confidential support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. The CPS office is staffed by professional psychologists who are attuned to the needs of all types of college and professional students. Please do not hesitate to contact CPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do.\n\n\nBasic needs security\nIf you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, and you believe this may affect your performance in this course, please contact the Dean of Students for support. They can provide a host of services including free groceries from the Panther Pantry and assisting with homelessness with the Embark Network. Additionally, please talk to me if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable me to provide any resources that I might possess.\n\n\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or GSU police (404-413-3333).\nIf you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call GSU’s Counseling and Psychological Services (404-413-1640).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Georgia State. GSU has instituted procedures to respond to violations of these laws and standards, programs aimed at the prevention of such conduct, and intervention on behalf of the victims. Georgia State University Police officers will treat victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking with respect and dignity. Advocates on campus and in the community can help with victims’ physical and emotional health, reporting options, and academic concerns.\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nViolation of GSU’s Policy on Academic Honesty will result in an F in the course and possible disciplinary action.2 All violations will be formally reported to the Dean of Students.\n\n\nSpecial needs\nStudents who wish to request accommodation for a disability may do so by registering with the Office of Disability Services. Students may only be accommodated upon issuance by the Office of Disability Services of a signed Accommodation Plan and are responsible for providing a copy of that plan to instructors of all classes in which accommodations are sought.\nStudents with special needs should then make an appointment with me during the first week of class to discuss any accommodations that need to be made."

For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs \\(5.75 and this other costs \\)40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.",

It’s better to do this:\n---\ntitle: \"My cool title: a subtitle\"\n---\nIf you want to use quotes inside one of the values (e.g. your document is An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"), you can use single quotes instead:\n---\ntitle: 'An evaluation of \"scare quotes\"'\n---",

    "text": "Citations\nOne of the most powerful features of Markdown + pandoc is the ability to automatically cite things and generate bibliographies. to use citations, you need to create a BibTeX file (ends in .bib) that contains a database of the things you want to cite. You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\n\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n---\ntitle: Title of your document\ndate: \"June 4, 2024\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nbibliography: name_of_file.bib\n---\nChoose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n---\ntitle: Title of your document\ndate: \"June 4, 2024\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nbibliography: name_of_file.bib\ncsl: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\"\n---\nSome of the most common CSLs are:\n\nChicago author-date\nChicago note-bibliography\nChicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids)\nAPA 7th edition\nMLA 8th edition\n\nCite things in your document.

    "section": "Part 3: RStudio Projects",
    "text": "Part 3: RStudio Projects\nOne of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its ability to manage projects.\nWhen you first open R, it is “pointed” at some folder on your computer, and anything you do will be relative to that folder. The technical term for this is a “working directory.”\nWhen you first open RStudio, look in the area right at the top of the Console pane to see your current working directory. Most likely you’ll see something cryptic: ~/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat tilde sign (~) is a shortcut that stands for your user directory. On Windows this is C:\\Users\\your_user_name\\; on macOS this is /Users/your_user_name/. With the working directory set to ~/, R is “pointed” at that folder, and anything you save will end up in that folder, and R will expect any data that you load to be there too.\nIt’s always best to point R at some other directory. If you don’t use RStudio, you need to manually set the working directory to where you want it with setwd(), and many R scripts in the wild include something like setwd(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\bill\\\\Desktop\\\\Important research project\") at the beginning to change the directory. THIS IS BAD THOUGH (see here for an explanation). If you ever move that directory somewhere else, or run the script on a different computer, or share the project with someone, the path will be wrong and nothing will run and you will be sad.\nThe best way to deal with working directories with RStudio is to use RStudio Projects. These are special files that RStudio creates for you that end in a .Rproj extension. When you open one of these special files, a new RStudio instance will open up and be pointed at the correct directory automatically. If you move the folder later or open it on a different computer, it will work just fine and you will not be sad.\nRead this super short chapter on RStudio projects.\nIn general, you can create a new project by going to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; Empty Project, which will create a new folder on your computer that is empty except for a single .Rproj file. Double click on that file to open an RStudio instance that is pointed at the correct folder.",

It doesn’t require any extra packages to use.\n\nIn 99% of cases, the two pipes are the same (see here for details about their differences; or see this too). The magrittr %&gt;% is still wildly popular and you’ll see code online that uses it. The main downside to the magrittr pipe is that it requires that you load a package to use it. If you run library(tidyverse), you’ll have access to it, and in this class you’ll load tidyverse 100% of the time, so you can use %&gt;% without any problems.\nI switched my R classes away from %&gt;% to |&gt; starting in January 2024, mostly following the example of Hadley Wickham (inventor of ggplot, dplyr, and pretty much all the tidyverse). The first edition of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund used the magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) extensively, which is partially why it became so popular. In the second edition of R for Data Science, though, published in June 2023, they switched to the native pipe (|&gt;). I took that as a cue to do the same in my own R work.\nSo I’m teaching you the native pipe (|&gt;). But don’t panic if you see the magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) out there. And feel free to use it too. Again, 99% of the time, it works the same:\n\n# {magrittr} pipe\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) %&gt;% mean()\n## [1] 3\n\n\n# Native pipe\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) |&gt; mean()\n## [1] 3\n\nJust don’t mix the two pipes in the same chain of functions.

When you unzip a zipped file, your operating system extracts all the files that are contained inside into a new folder on your computer.\nUnzipping files on macOS is trivial, but unzipping files on Windows can mess you up if you don’t pay careful attention.

If you double click on the .zip file, Windows will show you what’s inside, but it will do so without actually extracting anything. This can be is incredibly confusing! Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view. However, if you do, things will break and you won’t be able to correctly work with any of the files in the zipped folder. If you open the R Project file, for instance, RStudio will point to a bizarre working directory buried deep in some temporary folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou most likely won’t be able to open any data files or save anything, which will be frustrating.\nInstead, you need to right click on the .zip file and select “Extract All…”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen choose where you want to unzip all the files and click on “Extract”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should then finally have a real folder with all the contents of the zipped file.

If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty&gt;10,class==\"compact\"), I might recommend adding spaces, but it won’t affect your grade or points or anything.\n\n\nSpacing\n\nSee the “Spacing” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nPut spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10)\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg , cty &gt; 10)\nfilter(mpg ,cty &gt; 10)\nfilter(mpg,cty &gt; 10)\n\nPut spaces around operators like +, -, &gt;, =, etc.:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10)\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg, cty&gt;10)\nfilter(mpg, cty&gt; 10)\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt;10)\n\nDon’t put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10)\n\n# Bad\nfilter (mpg, cty &gt; 10)\nfilter ( mpg, cty &gt; 10)\nfilter( mpg, cty &gt; 10 )\n\n\n\nLong lines\n\nSee the “Long lines” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nIt’s generally good practice to not have really long lines of code. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” &gt; “Global Options” &gt; “Code” &gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, \n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg,\n       cty &gt; 10,\n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, \n       cty &gt; 10, \n       class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \n                    \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n\n\nPipes (|&gt;) and ggplot layers (+)\nPut each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))\n  + geom_point()\n  + geom_smooth() \n  + theme_bw()\n\nPut each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the |&gt; at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt; \n  group_by(class) |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Bad\nmpg |&gt; filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt; group_by(class) |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad\nmpg |&gt; filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt; group_by(class) |&gt; summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10)\n  |&gt; group_by(class)\n  |&gt; summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n\n\nComments\n\nSee the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nComments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n\n# Good\n\n#Bad\n\n    #Bad\n\nIf the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt;  # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) |&gt;  # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nYou can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt;            # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) |&gt;             # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nIf the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines. RStudio can do this for you if you go to “Code” &gt; “Reflow comment”\n\n# Good\n# Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\n# Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house.
