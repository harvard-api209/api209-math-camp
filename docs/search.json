For instance, GSU has a special “Georgia State Blue” (■#0039A6) and a red accent (■#CC0000). The Urban Institute has a specific organizational color palette with all sorts of guidelines for comparing two groups, three groups, sequential data, diverging data, and other special situations. They have specific red and blue colors to use for political parties too, like ■#1696d2 for Democrats and ■#db2b27 for Republicans.\nI often find it helpful to make a little object that contains all the custom colors I want to use so I don’t have to remember what the cryptic hex codes mean. Here’s GSU’s full palette:\n\ngsu_colors &lt;- c(\n  \"#0039A6\", \"#CC0000\", \"#374057\", \"#0071CE\",\n  \"#00AEEF\", \"#97CAEB\", \"#EEEEEE\", \"#CCCCCC\", \"#767679\"\n)\n\nYou can access these colors by number:\n\ngsu_colors[1:2]\n## [1] \"#0039A6\" \"#CC0000\"\ngsu_colors[5]\n## [1] \"#00AEEF\"\ngsu_colors[c(3, 5, 9)]\n## [1] \"#374057\" \"#00AEEF\" \"#767679\"\n\nAnd you can use the show_col() function from the {scales} library to show them all:\n\nscales::show_col(gsu_colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use them in scale_fill_manual()/scale_color_manual() too:\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = gsu_colors[1:5]\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to be extra fancy, you can create more official custom color palettes like scale_fill_gsu().",

    "text": "Perceptually uniform and scientifically calibrated palettes\nYou aren’t limited to just the default ggplot color palettes, or even the default viridis palettes. There are lots of other perceptually uniform palettes that use special ranges of color that can either (1) be used as a sequential gradient or (2) be chopped up into equal distances to create recognizable distinct colors.\n\nThe Okabe-Ito palette\nMasataka Okabe and Kei Ito developed a qualitative color palette for all types of color-vision deficiencies in 2008, and Claus Wilke uses it throughout his Fundamentals of Data Visualization book that we use in this class (he explains why here).\n\nYou can use it with the {ggokabeito} package and scale_fill_okabe_ito()/scale_color_okabe_ito():\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_okabe_ito()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nviridis\nYou’ve seen the regular green/blue/yellow viridis palette throughout the class, but there are are a bunch of other palettes within viridis like magma, plasma, inferno, mako, rocket, and turbo.\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the viridis palettes are diverging, but they work great for both sequential and qualitative data.\nThe viridis palettes come with {ggplot2} and you can use them with scale_fill_viridis_d()/scale_color_viridis_d() for discrete data and scale_fill_viridis_c()/scale_color_viridis_c() for continuous data.\n\nplasmainfernomakoturbo\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"inferno\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"mako\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific colour maps\nThe {scico} package provides a ton of other similar well-designed palettes from the Scientific Colour Maps project. The project includes sequential, diverging, and qualitative palettes and even has multi-sequential and cyclic palettes.\n\nAfter loading the {scico} package, you can use these palettes with scale_fill_scico_d()/scale_color_scico_d() for discrete data and scale_fill_scico_c()/scale_color_scico_c() for continuous data.\n\nbatlowbamakohawaiiroma (diverging)broc (diverging)\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"batlow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"bamako\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"hawaii\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_diverging +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"roma\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_diverging +\n  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"broc\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColorBrewer\nGeographer Cynthia Brewer developed a set of color palettes designed specifically for improving the readability of maps, but her palettes work incredibly well for regular plots too. There’s also a fantastic companion website for exploring all the different palettes, categories by sequential/diverging/qualitatitve, with options to filter by colorblind friendliness and print friendliness.\n\nTo use one of the palettes, note what it’s called at the website and use that name as the palette argument. The ColorBrewer palettes come with {ggplot2} and you can use them with scale_fill_brewer()/scale_color_brewer() for discrete data and scale_fill_distiller()/scale_color_distiller() for continuous data.\n\nYlOrRd (sequential)PuOr (diverging)Set1 (qualitative)\n\n\n\nplot_sequential +\n  scale_color_distiller(palette = \"YlOrRd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_diverging +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"PuOr\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_qualitative +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCARTOColors\nThe commerical GIS service CARTO created CARTOColors: a set of open source geographic-like colors just like ColorBrewer. Again, these were originally designed for maps, but they work great for regular data visualization too.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to install the {rcartocolor} package to use them. After loading {rcartocolor}, you can use any of the palettes with scale_fill_carto_d()/scale_color_carto_d() for discrete data and scale_fill_carto_c()/scale_color_carto_c() for continuous data.

    "text": "RStudio on your computer\nPosit.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of Posit.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since Posit.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.4.0) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nR packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including {ggplot2}) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n\n\nInstall TinyTeX\nWhen you render to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s a smaller version named TinyTeX that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows and automatically installs any missing LaTeX packages as needed.\nHere’s how to install TinyTeX so you can create pretty PDFs:\n\nOpen the Terminal panel in RStudio (down in the bottom left corner where the Console panel is; there’s a tab named “Terminal” there)\nType this:\nquarto install tinytex",

    "text": "Pipe styles\nThere are actually two pipe operators in R, and you’ll see both in the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\nRené Magritte, “The Treachery of Images”\n\n\n\nThe %&gt;% operator was invented first in 2014 in an R package named {magrittr}, a pun on René Magritte’s famous painting of a pipe, “The Treachery of Images”.\nThe |&gt; operator was added as a native part of R itself with version 4.1.0 in May 2021. It doesn’t require any extra packages to use.\n\nIn 99% of cases, the two pipes are the same (see here for details about their differences; or see this too). The magrittr %&gt;% is still wildly popular and you’ll see code online that uses it. The main downside to the magrittr pipe is that it requires that you load a package to use it. If you run library(tidyverse), you’ll have access to it, and in this class you’ll load tidyverse 100% of the time, so you can use %&gt;% without any problems.\nI switched my R classes away from %&gt;% to |&gt; starting in January 2024, mostly following the example of Hadley Wickham (inventor of ggplot, dplyr, and pretty much all the tidyverse). The first edition of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund used the magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) extensively, which is partially why it became so popular. In the second edition of R for Data Science, though, published in June 2023, they switched to the native pipe (|&gt;). I took that as a cue to do the same in my own R work.\nSo I’m teaching you the native pipe (|&gt;). But don’t panic if you see the magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) out there. And feel free to use it too. Again, 99% of the time, it works the same:\n\n# {magrittr} pipe\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) %&gt;% mean()\n## [1] 3\n\n\n# Native pipe\nc(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) |&gt; mean()\n## [1] 3\n\nJust don’t mix the two pipes in the same chain of functions.

This is a continuation of the pre-summer assignment you completed, where you started using Posit Cloud. There is no formal syllabus for this course, as it is designed to be hands-on and interactive, emphasizing practical application over traditional lecture formats.\n\nCourse Objectives\nBy the end of this summer camp, you will be able to:\n\nMaster Advanced Data Manipulation Techniques: Apply complex filtering, selection, and data reshaping operations using the tidyverse.\nCreate Elegant Data Visualizations: Utilize advanced ggplot2 features to produce publication-quality visuals and interactive plots.\nBuild and Interpret Statistical Models: Develop and diagnose statistical models, including regression and mixed models, to analyze real-world data.\nAutomate and Reproduce Research Workflows: Use RMarkdown and workflow automation tools to create reproducible, efficient research workflows.\n\n\n\nKey Topics\n1. Data Mastery in R - Session 1: Mastering Data Manipulation in R - Advanced filtering and selection with dplyr - Complex mutate operations - Dynamic column selection\n2. Visualizing Data with Precision - Session 2: Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2 - Advanced ggplot2 concepts: layering, themes, and facets - Interactive visualizations with plotly\n3. Modeling the Real World - Session 3: Advanced Statistical Modeling in R - Regression models and mixed models - Model diagnostics and validation\n4. Streamlining Research with R - Session 4: Reproducible Research and Automation - Using RMarkdown for dynamic documents - Workflow automation with drake or targets\n\n\nRStudio vs. Positron\nIn this course, you’ll be primarily using RStudio and Posit Cloud as your development environments. However, it’s also worth exploring Positron, a new IDE designed to enhance your R programming experience with modern development tools and a sleek interface. Both IDEs offer robust support for R, but Positron brings some cutting-edge features that may be beneficial for more advanced users."

Don’t hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. Take breaks when you’re stuck!\nI like what Andrew Heiss usually tell his students when teaching R.\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like {ggplot2}—made this wise observation:\n\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc."

    "section": "Part 3: RStudio Projects",
    "text": "Part 3: RStudio Projects\nOne of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its ability to manage projects.\nWhen you first open R, it is “pointed” at some folder on your computer, and anything you do will be relative to that folder. The technical term for this is a “working directory.”\nWhen you first open RStudio, look in the area right at the top of the Console pane to see your current working directory. Most likely you’ll see something cryptic: ~/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat tilde sign (~) is a shortcut that stands for your user directory. On Windows this is C:\\Users\\your_user_name\\; on macOS this is /Users/your_user_name/. With the working directory set to ~/, R is “pointed” at that folder, and anything you save will end up in that folder, and R will expect any data that you load to be there too.\nIt’s always best to point R at some other directory. If you don’t use RStudio, you need to manually set the working directory to where you want it with setwd(), and many R scripts in the wild include something like setwd(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\bill\\\\Desktop\\\\Important research project\") at the beginning to change the directory. THIS IS BAD THOUGH (see here for an explanation). If you ever move that directory somewhere else, or run the script on a different computer, or share the project with someone, the path will be wrong and nothing will run and you will be sad.\nThe best way to deal with working directories with RStudio is to use RStudio Projects. These are special files that RStudio creates for you that end in a .Rproj extension. When you open one of these special files, a new RStudio instance will open up and be pointed at the correct directory automatically. If you move the folder later or open it on a different computer, it will work just fine and you will not be sad.\nRead this super short chapter on RStudio projects.\nIn general, you can create a new project by going to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory &gt; Empty Project, which will create a new folder on your computer that is empty except for a single .Rproj file. Double click on that file to open an RStudio instance that is pointed at the correct folder.",

For instance, if you write This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40, Markdown will treat everything that comes between the dollar signs as math, like so: “This book costs \\(5.75 and this other costs \\)40”.\nTo get around that, put a backslash (\\) in front of the dollar signs, so that This book costs \\$5.75 and this other costs \\$40 becomes “This book costs $5.75 and this other costs $40”.",

You can do this with bibliography managers designed to work with BibTeX directly (like BibDesk on macOS), or you can use Zotero (macOS and Windows) to export a .bib file. You can download an example .bib file of all the readings from this class here.\nComplete details for using citations can be found here. In brief, you need to do three things:\n\nAdd a bibliography: entry to the YAML metadata:\n---\ntitle: Title of your document\ndate: \"June 4, 2024\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nbibliography: name_of_file.bib\n---\nChoose a citation style based on a CSL file. The default is Chicago author-date, but you can choose from 2,000+ at this repository. Download the CSL file, put it in your project folder, and add an entry to the YAML metadata (or provide a URL to the online version):\n---\ntitle: Title of your document\ndate: \"June 4, 2024\"\nauthor: \"Your name\"\nbibliography: name_of_file.bib\ncsl: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/apa.csl\"\n---\nSome of the most common CSLs are:\n\nChicago author-date\nChicago note-bibliography\nChicago full note-bibliography (no shortened notes or ibids)\nAPA 7th edition\nMLA 8th edition\n\nCite things in your document. Check the documentation for full details of how to do this. Essentially, you use @citationkey inside square brackets ([]):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType…\n…to get…\n\n\n\n\nCausal inference is neat [@Rohrer:2018;\n@AngristPischke:2015].\nCausal inference is neat (Rohrer 2018; Angrist and Pischke 2015).\n\n\nCausal inference is neat [see @Rohrer:2018, p. 34;\nalso @AngristPischke:2015, chapter 1].\nCausal inference is neat (see Rohrer 2018, 34; also Angrist and Pischke 2015, chap. 1).\n\n\nAngrist and Pischke say causal inference is neat\n[-@AngristPischke:2015; see also @Rohrer:2018].\nAngrist and Pischke say causal inference is neat (2015; see also Rohrer 2018).\n\n\n@AngristPischke:2015 [chapter 1] say causal\ninference is neat, and @Rohrer:2018 agrees.\nAngrist and Pischke (2015, chap. 1) say causal inference is neat, and Rohrer (2018) agrees.\n\n\n\nAfter compiling, you should have a perfectly formatted bibliography added to the end of your document too:\n\nAngrist, Joshua D., and Jörn-Steffen Pischke. 2015.

This whole course website is created with Quarto.\nQuarto’s predecessor was called R Markdown and worked exclusively with R (though there are ways to use other languages in document). Quarto is essentially “R Markdown 2.0,” but it is designed to be language agnostic. You can use R, Python, Julia, Observable JS, and even Stata code all in the same document.

Here’s what it looks like—the only clues that this folder is really a .zip file are that there’s a “Compressed Folder Tools” tab at the top, and there’s a “Ratio” column that shows how much each file is compressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is very tempting to try to open files from this view.

A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ew), in RStudio go to “Tools” &gt; “Global Options” &gt; “Code” &gt; “Display” and check the box for “Show margin”. You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this—that’s fine. It’s just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, \n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg,\n       cty &gt; 10,\n       class == \"compact\")\n\n# Bad\nfilter(mpg, cty &gt; 10, class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n# Good\nfilter(mpg, \n       cty &gt; 10, \n       class %in% c(\"compact\", \"pickup\", \"midsize\", \"subcompact\", \n                    \"suv\", \"2seater\", \"minivan\"))\n\n\n\nPipes (|&gt;) and ggplot layers (+)\nPut each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\n  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class))\n  + geom_point()\n  + geom_smooth() \n  + theme_bw()\n\nPut each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the |&gt; at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n\n# Good\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt; \n  group_by(class) |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Bad\nmpg |&gt; filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt; group_by(class) |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad\nmpg |&gt; filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt; group_by(class) |&gt; summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n# Super bad and won't even work\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10)\n  |&gt; group_by(class)\n  |&gt; summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))\n\n\n\nComments\n\nSee the “Comments” section in the tidyverse style guide.\n\nComments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: #\n\n# Good\n\n#Bad\n\n    #Bad\n\nIf the comment is really short (and won’t cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code, separated by at least two spaces (it works with one space, but using a couple can enhance readability):\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt;  # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) |&gt;  # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nYou can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\n\nmpg |&gt; \n  filter(cty &gt; 10) |&gt;            # Only rows where cty is 10 +\n  group_by(class) |&gt;             # Divide into class groups\n  summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  # Find the average hwy in each group\n\nIf the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines.

This definition includes many foreign workers and international students, as well as refugees and, in some cases, their descendants (such as Palestinians born in refugee camps outside of the Palestinian territories). Estimates of unauthorized immigrants living in various countries are also included in these totals.\nTourists, foreign-aid workers, temporary workers employed abroad for less than a year, and overseas military personnel are typically not counted as migrants.",
