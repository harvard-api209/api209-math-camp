## Overview

In this week, we dive into the concepts of tidy data and data visualization. You'll learn how to organize your data in a format that is easy to manipulate and visualize. We will focus on transforming data into a "tidy" format where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. Additionally, we'll cover essential visualization techniques using `ggplot2` to explore and communicate your findings effectively.
