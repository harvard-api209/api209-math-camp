## Why Reproducibility?

### Are We in a Crisis?

- The **replication crisis** in social sciences has highlighted significant issues in the credibility of research findings.
- Many high-profile studies have failed to replicate, raising concerns about the **reliability** of published results.
- The crisis has prompted a call for greater **transparency** and **rigor** in research practices.

---

## The Replication Crisis

### What Went Wrong?

- **Selective Reporting**: Only significant findings get published, leading to publication bias.
- **P-Hacking**: Manipulating data and analyses until nonsignificant results become significant.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Opaque methodologies that others cannot replicate or verify.

---

## The Importance of Reproducibility

### Building Trust in Research

- Reproducibility ensures that research findings are not just a result of **chance** or **specific conditions**.
- It allows others to **verify results** and build upon them, fostering cumulative knowledge.
- **Transparent reporting** of data and methods strengthens the credibility and utility of research.

---

## How Can We Improve Reproducibility?

### Adopting Best Practices

- **Pre-registration**: Outlining the study design and analysis plan before data collection.
- **Open Data and Code**: Sharing data and analysis scripts for others to verify and use.
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Using tools like Quarto to create dynamic documents that combine analysis and narrative.

## Quarto: A Tool for Reproducible Research

### What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that enables researchers to create dynamic documents, reports, presentations, and websites.

---

## Why Quarto?

### The Need for Reproducible Research

- **Reproducibility** is a cornerstone of scientific research.
- Quarto ensures that your analysis and outputs (tables, figures, etc.) can be reproduced by others, enhancing the credibility of your work.
- **Integrated with R, Python, Julia, and Observable**: Quarto supports multiple languages, making it versatile for various research needs.

---

## Key Features of Quarto

1. **Dynamic Documents**: Create documents that are automatically updated with the latest data and analysis.
2. **Multiple Outputs**: Generate reports, presentations, blogs, and books from a single source.
3. **Version Control**: Integrates seamlessly with Git for version control, tracking changes, and collaboration.
4. **Cross-Platform**: Works with RStudio, VSCode, or directly from the command line.

---

## Why Use Quarto for Your Problem Sets?

### Consistency and Organization

- Quarto helps you **organize your code, analysis, and narrative** in a single document.
- It ensures that your problem sets are **well-documented** and **easily understandable**.

---

## Hands-On Practice

### What Weâ€™ll Do This Week

- **Set up Quarto**: Install and configure Quarto on your systems.
- **Create Your First Quarto Document**: Practice by creating a simple document that integrates text, code, and visualizations.
- **Reproducible Problem Sets**: Learn how to structure your problem sets to be fully reproducible.

---

## Getting Started with Quarto

### Installing Quarto

1. **Download and Install**: Visit [quarto.org](https://quarto.org) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. **Setting Up in RStudio**: Quarto integrates directly into RStudio. Once installed, you can start creating Quarto documents right from the IDE.

---

## Creating Your First Quarto Document

### A Quick Demo

- **Open RStudio** (or your preferred editor).
- **New Quarto Document**: Go to File > New File > Quarto Document.
- **Choose Format**: Decide between HTML, PDF, Word, or a presentation format like Reveal.js.
- **Add Content**: Start writing text, and insert code chunks to see how Quarto integrates code and narrative.

---

## Reproducible Research with Quarto

### Integrating Code and Narrative

- **Code Chunks**: Embed your analysis directly in the document.
- **Automatic Updates**: Quarto will automatically re-run code and update results when the data changes.
- **Easy Collaboration**: Share your Quarto files with others, and they can re-run the entire analysis with a single command.

---

## Best Practices for Quarto Documents

### Structuring Your Document

1. **Use Sections**: Organize your content into clear sections and subsections.
2. **Comment Your Code**: Make sure that each code chunk is well-commented for clarity.
3. **Version Control**: Regularly commit changes to your Quarto documents using Git.

---

## Quarto in Action

### Real-World Examples

- **Research Papers**: Automate the creation of research papers with Quarto, ensuring all analysis and plots are reproducible.
- **Presentations**: Create dynamic presentations like this one, where code can be executed live during the talk.
- **Blogs and Websites**: Share your research with the world by publishing Quarto documents as websites or blogs.

---

## Summary and Next Steps

### Why Quarto is Essential

- Ensures reproducibility, consistency, and clarity in your research.
- Simplifies the creation of dynamic documents and presentations.
- Helps you produce high-quality, professional outputs that can be shared and reproduced.

### Let's Practice!

- **Lab Activity**: In our lab sessions this week, we'll apply what we've learned by creating and refining Quarto documents for your problem sets.
