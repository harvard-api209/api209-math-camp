## Why Reproducibility?

### Are We in a Crisis?

- The **replication crisis** in social sciences has highlighted significant issues in the credibility of research findings.
- Many high-profile studies have failed to replicate, raising concerns about the **reliability** of published results.
- The crisis has prompted a call for greater **transparency** and **rigor** in research practices.

## The Replication Crisis

### What Went Wrong?

- **Selective Reporting**: Only significant findings get published, leading to publication bias.
- **P-Hacking**: Manipulating data and analyses until nonsignificant results become significant.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Opaque methodologies that others cannot replicate or verify.

## The Importance of Reproducibility

### Building Trust in Research

- Reproducibility ensures that research findings are not just a result of **chance** or **specific conditions**.
- It allows others to **verify results** and build upon them, fostering cumulative knowledge.
- **Transparent reporting** of data and methods strengthens the credibility and utility of research.

## How Can We Improve Reproducibility?

### Adopting Best Practices

- **Pre-registration**: Outlining the study design and analysis plan before data collection.
- **Open Data and Code**: Sharing data and analysis scripts for others to verify and use.
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Using tools like Quarto to create dynamic documents that combine analysis and narrative.

## Reproducibility: The Basics

:::{.incremental}
- **Reproducibility** refers to the ability to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials and procedures as the original investigator.
- This may involve using the same computer code or reimplementing statistical procedures in a different software package.
- In essence, reproducibility is analogous to a 'unit test' in software engineering, ensuring that the study’s results can be consistently obtained under the same conditions.

## Replicability: Expanding the Horizon

:::{.incremental}
- **Replicability** involves duplicating the results of a prior study by following the same procedures but using new data.
- This concept extends beyond mere reproduction and tests whether the findings hold true across different datasets or slightly altered conditions.
- Sometimes referred to as “scientific replication,” replicability is critical for validating the robustness and generalizability of research findings.

## Reproducibility vs. Replicability

    - duplication with the same data and procedures;
    - ensuring accuracy and precision.

:::{.column}
- [**Replicability**]{.box-crimson .fg-offwhite}: 
    - tests the findings using new data *but the same methods*;'
    - emphasizing robustness and generalization.

Both concepts are crucial for ensuring the credibility and reliability of research, but they serve different purposes within the scientific process.

## Quarto: A Tool for Reproducible Research

### What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that enables researchers to create dynamic documents, reports, presentations, and websites.


## Why Quarto?

### The Need for Reproducible Research

- Quarto ensures that your analysis and outputs (tables, figures, etc.) can be reproduced by others, enhancing the credibility of your work.
- **Integrated with R, Python, Julia, etc.**: Quarto supports multiple languages, making it versatile for various research needs.

</center>

## Key Features of Quarto

1. **Dynamic Documents**: 
  Create documents that are automatically updated with the latest data and analysis.
2. **Multiple Outputs**: 
  Generate reports, presentations, blogs, and books from a single source.
3. **Version Control**: 
  Integrates seamlessly with Git for version control, tracking changes, and collaboration.
4. **Cross-Platform**: 
  Works with RStudio, VSCode, or directly from the command line.

## Why Use Quarto for Your Problem Sets?

### Consistency and Organization

- Quarto helps you **organize your code, analysis, and narrative** in a single document.
- It ensures that your problem sets are **well-documented** and **easily understandable**.

## Why the name "Quarto"?[^1]

[^1]: [Why Quarto?](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/#why-the-name-quarto) From Posit "We wanted to use a name that had meaning in the history of publishing and landed on Quarto, which is the format of a book or pamphlet produced from full sheets printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves. The earliest known European printed book is a Quarto, the [Sibyllenbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyllenbuch_fragment), believed to have been printed by [Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) in 1452–53."
