## Course Overview

This summer camp focuses on advanced R programming, specifically on four key areas of data manipulation using the tidyverse. This is a continuation of the pre-summer assignment you completed, where you started using Posit Cloud. There is no formal syllabus for this course, as it is designed to be hands-on and interactive, emphasizing practical application over traditional lecture formats.

### Course Objectives

By the end of this summer camp, you will be able to:

- **Master Advanced Data Manipulation Techniques**: Apply complex filtering, selection, and data reshaping operations using the tidyverse.
- **Create Elegant Data Visualizations**: Utilize advanced `ggplot2` features to produce publication-quality visuals and interactive plots.
- **Build and Interpret Statistical Models**: Develop and diagnose statistical models, including regression and mixed models, to analyze real-world data.
- **Automate and Reproduce Research Workflows**: Use RMarkdown and workflow automation tools to create reproducible, efficient research workflows.

### Key Topics

**1. Data Mastery in R**
- **Session 1: Mastering Data Manipulation in R**
  - Advanced filtering and selection with `dplyr`
  - Complex mutate operations
  - Dynamic column selection

**2. Visualizing Data with Precision**
- **Session 2: Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2**
  - Advanced `ggplot2` concepts: layering, themes, and facets
  - Interactive visualizations with `plotly`

**3. Modeling the Real World**
- **Session 3: Advanced Statistical Modeling in R**
  - Regression models and mixed models
  - Model diagnostics and validation

**4. Streamlining Research with R**
- **Session 4: Reproducible Research and Automation**
  - Using `RMarkdown` for dynamic documents
  - Workflow automation with `drake` or `targets`
  
### RStudio vs. Positron

In this course, you'll be primarily using **RStudio** and **Posit Cloud** as your development environments. However, it's also worth exploring **Positron**, a new IDE designed to enhance your R programming experience with modern development tools and a sleek interface. Both IDEs offer robust support for R, but Positron brings some cutting-edge features that may be beneficial for more advanced users.

## Important Pep Talk!

**You can do this!** Programming can be challenging, but remember that frustration is part of the learning process. Don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it. Take breaks when you're stuck! 

I like what Andrew Heiss usually tell his students when teaching R. 

> Learning R can be difficult at first—it's like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like {ggplot2}—[made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/): 

> It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, "Oh it's me, I'm really stupid," or, "I'm not made out to program." But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

> Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you're finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.
