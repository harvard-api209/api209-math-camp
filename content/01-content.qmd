## Guiding Questions

::: {.callout-warning}

#### These are optional!

You don't need to answer all of theseâ€”or even any of them! They are here to help guide your thinking and reflection on the content. Feel free to explore whatever aspects you find most interesting.
:::

- How do complex filtering and selection operations enhance data analysis?
- What are the benefits of using the tidyverse for data manipulation?
- How do different data reshaping techniques (e.g., pivoting) impact the way data is analyzed and interpreted?
- What challenges do you encounter when working with large datasets, and how can they be overcome with efficient R techniques?
- How does the native pipe (`|>`) improve code readability and workflow in R?
